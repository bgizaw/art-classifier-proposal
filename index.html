<h1>art classifier</h1>

<h3>This software will function to take in an image of a painting and return the name of the piece, the artist, and when it was made.</h3>

<h3>I find this project to be interesting because it will allow my team as well as the people who use the software to learn more about art history. Learning more about the contexts around paintings can give insight to the state of the world as well as the person who made the art. It is also potentially interesting to think about the potential uses of this software to look into patterns certain artists follow when making art during a certain time period</h3>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If possible I would want it to be able to return a list of other paintings made by the same artist within 5 years or so of the given painting</li>
  <li>Another possible route would be to return a list of other paintings made by various artists that are visually similar to the one given, with all the same kinds of info provided with the original painting</li>
  <li>I want a major focus to be on accuracy, and the ability to perform well on some more low-quality images</li>
</ul>



<h2>Imagine I input an image of this Van Gogh painting</h2>
